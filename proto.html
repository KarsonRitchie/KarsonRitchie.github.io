							<h1 class="major">Simple games</h1>
							<p>We all have to start somewhere, and how I started with game development and trying to learn the engine is by making small and simple games.
						   </p>
						   <br>
						   <p>First example is a game I just call adding game</p>
							<span><img src="images/adding.png" alt="An image that shows the adding game I have created" /></span>
							<p>The goal of this game is to add numbers using your number keys to match the number on the right in exactly 10 moves. The game was inspired a puzzle in Resident Evil 0, 
								which shared the same concept.
							</p>
							<p>Here is a link to a youtube demonstration: <a href="https://youtu.be/PmS7KxYHkkU" target="_blank">Link</a></p>

							<br>
							<p>After that I decided to make another simple game I like to call 'Catch Em'</p>
							<span><img src="images/catch.png" alt="An image of the catching game I have created" /></span>
							<p>In this game you have 3 lives, and you need to catch falling objects before they go past you and hit the bottom.</p>

							<h1 class="major">Prototypes</h1>
							<p>After a while of not developing, I wanted a reason to motivate me. That is when I decided to actually delve into my favorite genre survival horror,
                                despite insisting I never would. However, doing so actually motivated me a lot and what resulted is a prototype of if I was making a game similar to
                                classic Resident Evil.
                           </p>
                           <br>
                           <p>I only have one example to show as of now.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/camera1.png" alt="An image of a very rough prototype for a survival horror game" /></span>
							<p>If the very blocky look didn't give it away, this was just meant to be a prototype to help me learn what I can do and how to use the engine. There are two prototypes I
                                made like this, however, they are the same, one is just programmed way better but both resulted in me becoming a more competent game developer.
                            </p>
							<p>In this prototype we have fixed camera angles</p>
							<span><img src="images/camera1.png" alt="The first image to demonstrate camera placement" /></span>
							<span><img src="images/camera2.png" alt="The second image to demonstrate along with the top one that cameras are fixed" /></span>
							<p>Even limited inventory and inventory stacking</p>
							<span><img src="images/inventory.png" alt="An image to demosntrate inventory slots and that some items stack" /></span>
							<p>There is other things like item interactions and tank controls, but the best way to show everything I did in this prototype is through a youtube video: 
								<a href="https://youtu.be/la6mMDPAMv4" target="_blank">Link</a></p>

							<br>
							<p>Another prototype is not here because it is just the first stage of my actual first project, Blackout.</p>
